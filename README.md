# Briefing Paper: Adlington New Town & the Risks of Private-Equity-Led Development

_Status: DRAFT - request for comments_

_Last updated: November 2025_

## 1. What is being proposed at Adlington?

- A **new town of at least 14,000 homes** on roughly 1,000 hectares of mainly greenfield land between Macclesfield and Greater Manchester, centred on **Adlington, Cheshire**.  
- The site is one of **12 locations shortlisted** by the Government’s **New Towns Taskforce** for a new generation of large settlements (each 10,000+ homes).  
- The developer’s materials describe a “**parkland town**” with:
  - Up to **40% “affordable” housing**, including some social rent and key worker homes.  
  - New schools, health facilities, community spaces, shops, offices and labs.  
  - Road upgrades (especially the A523), improved bus services and rail station upgrades.  
  - Extensive green space and preservation of **Adlington Hall** as a heritage and leisure hub.  

**Key point for residents:** this is not just a few extra estates – it is a proposal to turn a rural village and surrounding green belt into a new town many times the size of existing Adlington.

## 2. Who is driving the project?

### Private equity and investment firms

- The project is led by **Belport**, described as a UK-based “investment and asset management” company.  
- The main landowner is a **joint venture between Belport and Revcap**, a **private equity real estate fund** based in London.  
  - Belport and Revcap together own the majority of the proposed new town site.  
- The **New Towns Taskforce** specifically highlighted Adlington because:
  - It is largely owned by a single entity (Belport/Revcap JV).  
  - It needs little land remediation.  
  - High local house prices make it “viable” for investors.  

**Why this matters:** decisions about land, phasing and profit from the new town would be heavily shaped by **private equity investors**, not primarily by local democratic bodies.

## 3. What are local representatives and communities saying?

### MP and councils

- **Tim Roca, MP for Macclesfield**, has launched a **Parliamentary petition** calling on the Government to **abandon** the Adlington new town proposal.  
- Roca argues that:
  - Cheshire East has a democratically agreed **Local Plan** which already identifies where homes should go.  
  - There is substantial scope for **brownfield regeneration** and reuse of existing buildings in nearby towns before sacrificing green belt.  

### Protests and local campaigns

- **Protests** have already taken place in Adlington, with residents from surrounding areas joining to oppose the new town on grounds of:
  - Loss of green belt and wildlife habitat.  
  - Pressure on roads, NHS services, and schools.  
  - The scale (14,000+ homes) being completely out of proportion to the existing village.  
- Local and national groups involved include:
  - **CPRE Cheshire** and Cheshire Wildlife Trust, who are campaigning against the scheme and monitoring the process.  
  - Facebook groups such as **“Adlington New Town on Green Belt – No!”** and **“Supporters of the Adlington Green Belt”**, coordinating community opposition and information-sharing.  

### Government line on opposition

- The **Planning Minister** has said that local opposition **will not be allowed to block large new towns**, framing them as necessary for national housing targets.  

**Key message:** there is significant **local and regional opposition**, but national policy is signalling that large new towns may be pushed through *despite* local resistance.

## 4. Democratic accountability: where is the power?

### How the site was chosen

- The New Towns Taskforce considered 100+ potential locations and shortlisted 12, including Adlington, **without open local consultation**.  
- The Taskforce’s deputy chair has publicly acknowledged “ill feeling” around Adlington because **local communities were not engaged** during shortlisting for reasons of “confidentiality”.  

### Who controls the land and the plan?

- The **Belport/Revcap joint venture** owns most of the land and markets this as a strength, saying it allows “efficient decision-making” and “long-term stewardship”.  
- This concentrated ownership effectively gives a **private equity partnership huge leverage** over:
  - When and how phases of the town are built.  
  - What infrastructure is prioritised.  
  - Whether commitments on affordability and green space are kept or later reduced.

### What do the Lords say a good new town needs?

The House of Lords Built Environment Committee, in its report **“New Towns: Laying the Foundations”**, stresses that success requires:  

- Strong **government leadership**, not just leaving it to private developers.  
- Clear **masterplans with mechanisms for regular review** (e.g. every five years).  
- Secure long-term **funding for infrastructure** (transport, schools, healthcare).  
- Potential for the state to retain an **ownership stake** via a development corporation to ensure long-term public interest.

**Risk:** Adlington is emerging as a **privately led, investor-driven scheme**, rather than a publicly led development corporation. That raises questions about how residents can influence decisions and who will be accountable if promises are not met.

## 5. Risks linked to private equity involvement

### 5.1 Short-term profit vs long-term community need

Private equity funds typically:

- Seek to **maximise returns within a fixed time frame** (often 5–10 years).  
- Use **leverage (debt)** and financial engineering to boost profits.  
- Sell on assets once profit targets are achieved.

This can conflict with the needs of a new town, which require:

- **Up-front investment** in infrastructure (roads, rail, schools, health).  
- Ongoing **maintenance and stewardship** over decades.  
- Delivering genuinely **affordable housing**, even when margins are tight.

The Lords report explicitly warns that new towns need **“patient capital”** and alternative funding models, not just profit-driven finance.  

### 5.2 Example: private equity and the high street

The collapse of retailers such as **Debenhams** is frequently cited as a warning:

- Debenhams was bought by a private equity consortium in 2003.  
- Owners extracted **over £1bn in dividends**, sold off property and loaded the business with debt.  
- Debenhams later collapsed, with thousands of job losses and empty stores in town centres.  

This pattern – **“take value out, leave risk behind”** – is what worries many people about private equity running an entire new town.

### 5.3 Potential issues at Adlington

Community concerns include:

- **Affordable housing promises** (e.g. 40% of homes) may be cut back later via “viability” arguments if they hit profit margins.  
- **Infrastructure may lag** – homes might be built and sold quickly, while schools, surgeries and transport upgrades arrive late or only partially.  
- The town could be treated as an **investment product**, with:
  - Commercial areas and even community assets sold to the highest bidder.  
  - Little long-term commitment to affordable rents or community facilities.

## 6. Key talking points for community members

You can adapt these for letters, meetings, social media or petitions.

1. **Democracy and process**  
   - The Adlington new town was **selected behind closed doors** by a national taskforce, with minimal local consultation, then announced as a shortlist “done deal”.  
   - Decisions affecting our village for generations should be shaped through the **Local Plan and public consultation**, not by a private equity joint venture and a central taskforce.

2. **Scale and proportionality**  
   - 14,000+ homes would transform a small rural village and its green belt into a town larger than many existing Cheshire settlements.  
   - This is **far beyond what was ever envisaged** in local planning documents.

3. **Green belt and environment**  
   - The site lies in the **green belt**, close to the Peak District National Park. Once built on, the land is **irreversibly lost** for farming, biodiversity and carbon storage.  
   - National policy should prioritise **brownfield regeneration** and underused buildings before releasing high-quality green belt.

4. **Infrastructure and public services**  
   - Local roads, schools, GPs and hospitals are already under pressure. A development of this size risks **gridlock and overstretched services** if infrastructure is not in place *first*.  
   - The Lords have warned that **front-loaded investment** in transport and services is essential for new towns to succeed.  

5. **Private equity vs public interest**  
   - The main landowner is a **Belport–Revcap private equity joint venture**. Their first legal duty is to investors, not to residents.  
   - We have seen in the high street that private equity often extracts value quickly and moves on, leaving communities with the fallout. That model is **not suitable for planning and running a town**.

6. **Alternative approach**  
   - If new homes are needed, they should be:
     - Planned through **democratic local processes** (Local Plan).  
     - Built with **public oversight** and, ideally, some public ownership via a development corporation.  
     - Focused on **brownfield sites**, genuine affordability, and strong environmental protections.
