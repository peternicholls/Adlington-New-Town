# Adlington New Town: Private Equity, Housing, and Community Risk

_Status: DRAFT - request for comments_
_Last updated: November 2025_

## 1. Overview: What is “Adlington New Town”?

**Adlington New Town** is a proposed large-scale new settlement on greenfield land around **Adlington, Cheshire**, between Macclesfield and Greater Manchester.

Key facts:

- Scale: **At least 14,000 new homes** on roughly **1,000 hectares (c. 1,900 acres)** of mainly rural / green belt land (see the developer FAQ and reporting in Place North West for figures and maps: [Adlington New Town FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/), [Place North West – “Adlington new town pitch fleshed out”](https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/adlington-new-town-pitch-fleshed-out/)).  
- Current context: Adlington is currently a small rural village of around **1,200–1,300 residents** (local demographic estimates as referenced in [Macclesfield Nub News – Adlington topic](https://macclesfield.nub.news/topic/adlington-new-town)).  
- Status: The site is one of **12 locations shortlisted** by the UK Government’s **New Towns Taskforce** for a new generation of “new towns” (each 10,000+ homes), as set out in the Taskforce’s report to government ([New Towns Taskforce report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-towns-taskforce-report-to-government)).  

The proposal would transform Adlington from a small village into a town many times its current size, with a population that could easily reach **30,000–40,000 residents** once complete (simple extrapolation from 14,000+ dwellings).

---

## 2. Who Is Behind the Proposal?

### 2.1 The key players: Belport and Revcap

The Adlington scheme is being promoted and largely controlled by **private investment interests**:

- **Belport**  
  - A UK-based **investment and asset management** company and owner of Adlington Estate (see [Adlington New Town FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/)).  
  - Purchased the **Adlington Estate** (including historic Adlington Hall) in **2023** as a long-term asset, anticipating development opportunities (reported in [Place North West](https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/adlington-new-town-pitch-fleshed-out/)).  
  - Presents itself as a “responsible long-term steward” of land and heritage (language used on the developer’s website).

- **Revcap**  
  - A London-based **private equity real estate fund**.  
  - Describes itself as an **independent private equity real estate business**, investing in property joint ventures across Europe ([Revcap – About](https://www.revcap.co.uk/)).  
  - Founded by former Lehman Brothers real estate bankers and operates typical private equity fund structures.

- **Belport–Revcap Joint Venture**  
  - Belport and Revcap have formed a **joint venture that owns most of the land** earmarked for the new town (developer materials and Place North West coverage).  
  - This concentrated ownership was cited as a **key advantage** when Adlington was shortlisted by the New Towns Taskforce because it makes the site easier to assemble and develop at scale ([New Towns Taskforce report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-towns-taskforce-report-to-government)).  

### 2.2 Other partners

The venture has engaged:

- Planning and design consultancies.  
- Property advisors such as **CBRE** (mentioned in Place North West’s reporting).  
- PR and community engagement firms.

However, the **initiative did not originate with local government**. It emerged from:

1. A privately owned estate (Adlington Hall and surrounding land) acquired by an investment company.  
2. A central-government-led **New Towns Taskforce** process selecting sites based on “viability”, scale, and deliverability ([New Towns Taskforce – “New Towns: Creating Communities” inquiry](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/518/built-environment-committee/news/210030/new-towns-creating-communities-inquiry-launched-by-lords-built-environment-committee/)).  

Local authorities (e.g. **Cheshire East Council**) did not propose Adlington as a new town in their Local Plan; this is reflected in local coverage and statements from the area MP ([Macclesfield Nub News – petition article](https://macclesfield.nub.news/news/local-news/macclesfield-mp-launches-petition-to-stop-plans-for-new-town-in-adlington-276301)).

---

## 3. What Are the Developers Promising?

The developers’ public-facing material (e.g. the Adlington New Town website and FAQs, and coverage in Place North West) presents a **glossy vision**.

### 3.1 Housing and affordability

Promised headline features (see [Adlington New Town FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/) and [Place North West](https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/adlington-new-town-pitch-fleshed-out/)):

- **At least 14,000 homes**.  
- Housing mix including:  
  - Family homes, apartments, “tech-enabled” homes.  
  - Up to **40% “affordable housing”**, including:  
    - Social rent.  
    - Affordable rent.  
    - Shared ownership.  
    - Key worker housing.  

**Key concern:** Affordable housing shares in major developments are often later reduced through **“viability” assessments** when developers claim that costs make original commitments “unviable”. This pattern is well documented in planning commentary and case law, though not unique to Adlington.

### 3.2 Infrastructure and services

The concept masterplan and publicity material refer to (again, see [Adlington New Town FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/) and project coverage in [Place North West](https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/adlington-new-town-pitch-fleshed-out/)):

- New **primary and secondary schools**.  
- New **healthcare facilities** (GP/health centres).  
- A network of **community centres**, sports facilities, and cultural spaces.  
- Upgrades to the:  
  - **A523 and local road network**.  
  - **Adlington rail station** (lengthened platforms, improved services).  
  - Bus routes and active travel (walking/cycling).  

The scheme is sold as an “infrastructure-led” development where transport and social infrastructure will be integrated from the outset.

**Key concern:** In practice, infrastructure in large developments often **lags behind** housebuilding, leading to years of pressure on roads, schools and GPs. The House of Lords Built Environment Committee stresses that new towns need **front-loaded investment** in transport and services to succeed ([Lords report – summary](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/518/built-environment-committee/news/209876/new-towns-will-need-government-leadership-and-funding-says-new-lords-report/)).

### 3.3 Green space and heritage

The promotional narrative leans heavily on **heritage and landscape**:

- A “**parkland town**” with:  
  - Parks, woodlands, riverside walks, sports pitches.  
  - Habitat restoration and biodiversity corridors.  
- **Adlington Hall**:  
  - Promised as a **public cultural and leisure hub**, with improved public access to its historic grounds.  
  - Used as a central “brand” element to market the new town as unique and high-quality (developer site and Place North West coverage).  

**Key concern:** Strong environmental and heritage language may be used as a sales tool. Without binding legal protections and robust planning obligations, **the extent and quality of promised green space can be diluted** in later phases.

### 3.4 Economic and employment claims

The developers also claim (see [Adlington New Town FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/)):

- Creation of **thousands of jobs** via:  
  - Office space and labs (e.g. for life sciences and clean energy).  
  - Retail and leisure.  
  - Local services (schools, healthcare, hospitality, etc.).  
- A **“skills academy”** or training hub to support employment for residents.

**Key concern:** Job numbers and sectors are projections, not guarantees. There is a risk of **car‑dependent dormitory commuting** if local employment does not materialise at the promised scale.

## 4. Democratic Accountability and Process

### 4.1 How was Adlington chosen?

The **New Towns Taskforce**:

- Considered over **100 potential locations** across England for the next wave of new towns.  
- Shortlisted **12 sites**, including Adlington, based on:  
  - Scale (ability to deliver 10,000+ homes).  
  - Deliverability (land control, fewer physical constraints).  
  - Market “viability” (house price levels, investor interest).  

These points are set out in the Taskforce’s report and surrounding commentary ([New Towns Taskforce report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-towns-taskforce-report-to-government), [Lords “New Towns: Creating Communities” inquiry page](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/518/built-environment-committee/news/210030/new-towns-creating-communities-inquiry-launched-by-lords-built-environment-committee/)).

The Taskforce’s deputy chair, **Dame Kate Barker**, has acknowledged that:

- They **did not consult local communities** while drawing up the shortlist, citing confidentiality.  
- This caused “a lot of ill feeling” around sites like Adlington.  
- She has said that extensive **future community engagement** will be needed.  

These comments are reported in [Place North West – “New Towns Taskforce deputy chair acknowledges public ill feeling around Adlington”](https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/new-towns-taskforce-deputy-chair-acknowledges-public-ill-feeling-around-adlington/).

**Implication:** The shortlist emerged from a **closed process** between central government and landowners/investors, not from normal local plan‑making or democratic debate.

### 4.2 Role of local councils and the MP

- **Cheshire East Council**:  
  - Has an adopted **Local Plan** which identifies where housing growth should take place.  
  - Did **not propose** a new town at Adlington in its plan; this is reflected in statements and coverage by local media.  
- **Tim Roca, MP for Macclesfield**:  
  - Has stated he was **not consulted** in selecting Adlington for the short list and only learned of it via the government announcement.  
  - Has launched a **Parliamentary petition** calling on the Government to **drop the Adlington new town** ([Macclesfield Nub News – petition article](https://macclesfield.nub.news/news/local-news/macclesfield-mp-launches-petition-to-stop-plans-for-new-town-in-adlington-276301)).  
  - Argues that housing need can be met through the existing Local Plan and brownfield regeneration, and that the green belt around Adlington is of high environmental and landscape value (same source).  

### 4.3 House of Lords view on how new towns should be run

The **House of Lords Built Environment Committee** report, _“New Towns: Laying the Foundations”_, makes several key points ([Lords summary](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/518/built-environment-committee/news/209876/new-towns-will-need-government-leadership-and-funding-says-new-lords-report/)):

- **Public leadership is essential**  
  New towns should not be left entirely to private developers. Government must provide clear strategy, leadership and oversight.

- **Development corporations and public stake**  
  The report recommends using **development corporations** with potential for the state (local and/or central) to hold an ownership stake, ensuring **long‑term public interest** and preventing purely speculative development.

- **Funding and “patient capital”**  
  New towns need secure, long‑term funding and **“patient capital”**, so that infrastructure and community facilities can be delivered early and maintained over decades.

**Contrast with Adlington:**  
At present, Adlington appears as a **developer‑led, private‑equity‑heavy proposal** with no clear development corporation or public ownership stake in sight.

## 5. Community Concerns and Local Responses

### 5.1 Main concerns from residents and groups

Local residents, campaigners, and some elected representatives have raised (see [Macclesfield Nub News coverage](https://macclesfield.nub.news/topic/adlington-new-town), [CPRE Cheshire briefing](https://www.cprecheshire.org.uk/news/nov-2025-adlington-new-town-public-engagement/)):

1. **Scale and character**  
   - 14,000+ homes would **overwhelm** the existing village and transform it into a town larger than many neighbouring settlements.  
   - The **rural character** and semi‑rural feel of the area would be lost.

2. **Green belt and environment**  
   - The site lies largely in the **green belt**, close to the **Peak District National Park**.  
   - Concerns include: loss of farmland, impact on biodiversity, urban sprawl, coalescence of settlements, and climate/flood risk.

3. **Transport and congestion**  
   - The **A523 and surrounding road network** already struggle with congestion.  
   - Adlington rail station is small, with limited services and short platforms.  
   - Fear that many residents would rely on cars, leading to severe congestion and rat‑running (raised in both local reporting and CPRE’s commentary).

4. **Public services**  
   - Local **schools, GP surgeries and hospitals** are already under strain.  
   - Doubts that new facilities will be built early enough, located appropriately, and adequately funded / staffed.

5. **Process and fairness**  
   - Residents feel that decisions are being made **about them, without them**, a theme that runs through local news articles and CPRE’s briefing.

6. **Precedent**  
   - Many worry that if Adlington is allowed, it sets a precedent for other **green belt new towns** driven by private finance, undermining green belt protections nationally.

### 5.2 Local campaigns and mobilisation

- **Formal petition**  
  MP Tim Roca’s petition calls on the Government to abandon the Adlington new town proposal ([petition article](https://macclesfield.nub.news/news/local-news/macclesfield-mp-launches-petition-to-stop-plans-for-new-town-in-adlington-276301)).  

- **Local protest and organising**  
  - Protests and community meetings have taken place in and around Adlington ([Macclesfield Nub News – protest article](https://macclesfield.nub.news/news/local-news/community-comes-together-to-protest-plans-to-establish-new-town-in-adlington-276774)).  
  - Facebook and community groups coordinate sharing information, organising events, and letter‑writing campaigns.

- **NGO involvement**  
  - Organisations like **CPRE Cheshire** and **Cheshire Wildlife Trust** have become involved ([CPRE briefing](https://www.cprecheshire.org.uk/news/nov-2025-adlington-new-town-public-engagement/)).

## 6. Private Equity Track Record: Why It Matters Here

### 6.1 What is private equity?

**Private equity (PE)** refers to investment funds that buy stakes in companies or assets (including property) with the aim of:

- Increasing their value (or extracting value).  
- Selling them or floating them on the stock market within a certain timeframe.  
- Delivering high returns to investors (often pension funds, wealthy individuals, etc.).  

Typical features:

- Use of **leverage (borrowing)** to amplify returns.  
- Strong focus on **short‑ to medium‑term financial performance** (e.g. 5–10 years).  
- Decisions made in private, not subject to normal public scrutiny.  

Good general background is provided by many financial explainers; here we focus on **real estate private equity**, as exemplified by Revcap’s own description of its activities ([Revcap – strategy](https://www.revcap.co.uk/strategy/)).

### 6.2 PE and the high street: an example

The collapse of **Debenhams** is often cited (see e.g. [The Guardian – “How private equity ruined Debenhams”](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/01/how-private-equity-ruined-debenhams-retail-hell)). Key points from that reporting:

- Debenhams was bought by a private equity consortium in 2003.  
- Over a few years:  
  - The private equity owners extracted **over £1 billion in dividends**.  
  - Sold off large parts of Debenhams’ property portfolio.  
  - Loaded the company with substantial debt.  
- Once the investors exited, Debenhams was left weakened and heavily indebted.  
- Debenhams ultimately **collapsed**, leading to thousands of job losses and empty units in town centres.  

This has been described as a **“quick flip”** model: take value out early, leave long‑term risk with workers, communities, and the wider economy.

### 6.3 Why is this relevant to a new town?

A **new town is not just a property deal**; it is a long‑term social project, dependent on:

- Infrastructure investment.  
- Ongoing maintenance of public realm.  
- Stable, affordable housing.  
- Health of local services and economies over decades.  

There is a fundamental tension when:

- A **private equity joint venture** controls land and key decisions.  
- Its main duty is to **maximise investor returns** within a limited timeframe.  
- Public interest demands long‑term, sometimes less immediately profitable choices (e.g. high affordable housing quotas, expensive infrastructure, preserving more green space).  

Potential risks include:

- **Affordable housing promises being watered down** later through viability arguments.  
- **Delayed or partial delivery** of infrastructure once key phases of housing are built and sold.  
- Sale of strategic assets (e.g. commercial centres, car parks, community facilities) to other investors, potentially pushing up costs for residents.  
- Little incentive to **invest in long‑term stewardship** of public spaces once the initial development profit is realised.  

These concerns are not unique to Adlington but are heightened when **private equity** is at the core of the project, as here ([Revcap](https://www.revcap.co.uk/), [Adlington New Town FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/)).

### 6.4 “Stalking horse” concerns

Some planning commentators have suggested that huge schemes like Adlington (e.g. 14,000–20,000 homes plus full infrastructure) can sometimes act as **“stalking horses”**:

- Developers propose a very large, infrastructure‑rich vision.  
- After prolonged controversy and negotiation, they seek approval for a **much smaller scheme**:  
  - Fewer homes.  
  - Reduced or minimal infrastructure.  
- This smaller scheme still yields substantial profit, but **much of the public benefit never materialises**.

While this is an interpretation rather than a proven intention, it is a scenario highlighted in planning commentary and is consistent with past behaviour in some large‑scale developments (see critical analysis in regional planning blogs and comment pieces, often citing Adlington as a test case).

## 7. Conclusion: A Test Case for Private-Led New Towns

Adlington New Town sits at the intersection of:

- **Genuine housing pressure**, and  
- A **new model of development** where:  
  - Private equity owns and drives the project.  
  - National government sets targets and exerts pressure.  
  - Local democratic structures are sidelined or overruled.  

Key conclusions:

1. **Scale and environmental impact**  
   - The proposed scale would permanently transform a small rural village and its green belt surroundings into a large town, with profound environmental and landscape consequences (developer and media sources: [Adlington FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/), [Place North West](https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/adlington-new-town-pitch-fleshed-out/)).  

2. **Democratic deficit**  
   - Site selection and early decisions were made between central government and landowners, with **minimal local consultation** ([Place North West – ill feeling article](https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/new-towns-taskforce-deputy-chair-acknowledges-public-ill-feeling-around-adlington/)).  
   - Local plans and local voices risk being treated as obstacles rather than foundations.

3. **Private equity vs public good**  
   - The central role of a **Belport–Revcap private equity joint venture** means that decisions are likely to be guided by return on investment rather than community needs ([Adlington FAQs](https://www.adlingtonnewtown.com/faqs/), [Revcap](https://www.revcap.co.uk/)).  
   - Past PE behaviour in other sectors (like retail) is cause for serious caution ([Guardian – Debenhams and PE](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/01/how-private-equity-ruined-debenhams-retail-hell)).  

4. **Governance gaps**  
   - There is no clear commitment yet to:  
     - A **publicly led development corporation**.  
     - Public ownership stakes in land or infrastructure.  
     - Robust, enforceable guarantees on affordable housing and infrastructure delivery.  
   - This runs counter to the direction suggested by the House of Lords Built Environment Committee ([Lords “New Towns” summary](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/518/built-environment-committee/news/209876/new-towns-will-need-government-leadership-and-funding-says-new-lords-report/)).  

5. **Precedent for the future**  
   - If Adlington proceeds on this model, it will set a national precedent for **private‑equity‑led new towns on green belt**, shaping how similar proposals are put forward and justified elsewhere.

For communities, the central question is:

> **Can a new town conceived as an investment vehicle truly serve long‑term public interest?**

Until robust democratic controls, public stakes, and binding obligations are clearly in place, many local residents and observers argue that the answer is **no**, and that Adlington New Town in its current form should be **resisted or fundamentally reshaped**.
