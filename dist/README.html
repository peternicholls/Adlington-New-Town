<p><em>Status: DRAFT - request for comments</em></p>
<p><em>Last updated: November 2025</em></p>
<h2 id="1.-what-is-being-proposed-at-adlington%3F" tabindex="-1">1. What is being proposed at Adlington?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>new town of at least 14,000 homes</strong> on roughly 1,000 hectares of mainly greenfield land between Macclesfield and Greater Manchester, centred on <strong>Adlington, Cheshire</strong>.</li>
<li>The site is one of <strong>12 locations shortlisted</strong> by the Government’s <strong>New Towns Taskforce</strong> for a new generation of large settlements (each 10,000+ homes).</li>
<li>The developer’s materials describe a “<strong>parkland town</strong>” with:
<ul>
<li>Up to <strong>40% “affordable” housing</strong>, including some social rent and key worker homes.</li>
<li>New schools, health facilities, community spaces, shops, offices and labs.</li>
<li>Road upgrades (especially the A523), improved bus services and rail station upgrades.</li>
<li>Extensive green space and preservation of <strong>Adlington Hall</strong> as a heritage and leisure hub.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key point for residents:</strong> this is not just a few extra estates – it is a proposal to turn a rural village and surrounding green belt into a new town many times the size of existing Adlington.</p>
<h2 id="2.-who-is-driving-the-project%3F" tabindex="-1">2. Who is driving the project?</h2>
<h3 id="private-equity-and-investment-firms" tabindex="-1">Private equity and investment firms</h3>
<ul>
<li>The project is led by <strong>Belport</strong>, described as a UK-based “investment and asset management” company.</li>
<li>The main landowner is a <strong>joint venture between Belport and Revcap</strong>, a <strong>private equity real estate fund</strong> based in London.
<ul>
<li>Belport and Revcap together own the majority of the proposed new town site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>New Towns Taskforce</strong> specifically highlighted Adlington because:
<ul>
<li>It is largely owned by a single entity (Belport/Revcap JV).</li>
<li>It needs little land remediation.</li>
<li>High local house prices make it “viable” for investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> decisions about land, phasing and profit from the new town would be heavily shaped by <strong>private equity investors</strong>, not primarily by local democratic bodies.</p>
<h2 id="3.-what-are-local-representatives-and-communities-saying%3F" tabindex="-1">3. What are local representatives and communities saying?</h2>
<h3 id="mp-and-councils" tabindex="-1">MP and councils</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tim Roca, MP for Macclesfield</strong>, has launched a <strong>Parliamentary petition</strong> calling on the Government to <strong>abandon</strong> the Adlington new town proposal.</li>
<li>Roca argues that:
<ul>
<li>Cheshire East has a democratically agreed <strong>Local Plan</strong> which already identifies where homes should go.</li>
<li>There is substantial scope for <strong>brownfield regeneration</strong> and reuse of existing buildings in nearby towns before sacrificing green belt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="protests-and-local-campaigns" tabindex="-1">Protests and local campaigns</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protests</strong> have already taken place in Adlington, with residents from surrounding areas joining to oppose the new town on grounds of:
<ul>
<li>Loss of green belt and wildlife habitat.</li>
<li>Pressure on roads, NHS services, and schools.</li>
<li>The scale (14,000+ homes) being completely out of proportion to the existing village.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local and national groups involved include:
<ul>
<li><strong>CPRE Cheshire</strong> and Cheshire Wildlife Trust, who are campaigning against the scheme and monitoring the process.</li>
<li>Facebook groups such as <strong>“Adlington New Town on Green Belt – No!”</strong> and <strong>“Supporters of the Adlington Green Belt”</strong>, coordinating community opposition and information-sharing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="government-line-on-opposition" tabindex="-1">Government line on opposition</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Planning Minister</strong> has said that local opposition <strong>will not be allowed to block large new towns</strong>, framing them as necessary for national housing targets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key message:</strong> there is significant <strong>local and regional opposition</strong>, but national policy is signalling that large new towns may be pushed through <em>despite</em> local resistance.</p>
<h2 id="4.-democratic-accountability%3A-where-is-the-power%3F" tabindex="-1">4. Democratic accountability: where is the power?</h2>
<h3 id="how-the-site-was-chosen" tabindex="-1">How the site was chosen</h3>
<ul>
<li>The New Towns Taskforce considered 100+ potential locations and shortlisted 12, including Adlington, <strong>without open local consultation</strong>.</li>
<li>The Taskforce’s deputy chair has publicly acknowledged “ill feeling” around Adlington because <strong>local communities were not engaged</strong> during shortlisting for reasons of “confidentiality”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-controls-the-land-and-the-plan%3F" tabindex="-1">Who controls the land and the plan?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Belport/Revcap joint venture</strong> owns most of the land and markets this as a strength, saying it allows “efficient decision-making” and “long-term stewardship”.</li>
<li>This concentrated ownership effectively gives a <strong>private equity partnership huge leverage</strong> over:
<ul>
<li>When and how phases of the town are built.</li>
<li>What infrastructure is prioritised.</li>
<li>Whether commitments on affordability and green space are kept or later reduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-do-the-lords-say-a-good-new-town-needs%3F" tabindex="-1">What do the Lords say a good new town needs?</h3>
<p>The House of Lords Built Environment Committee, in its report <strong>“New Towns: Laying the Foundations”</strong>, stresses that success requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong <strong>government leadership</strong>, not just leaving it to private developers.</li>
<li>Clear <strong>masterplans with mechanisms for regular review</strong> (e.g. every five years).</li>
<li>Secure long-term <strong>funding for infrastructure</strong> (transport, schools, healthcare).</li>
<li>Potential for the state to retain an <strong>ownership stake</strong> via a development corporation to ensure long-term public interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Adlington is emerging as a <strong>privately led, investor-driven scheme</strong>, rather than a publicly led development corporation. That raises questions about how residents can influence decisions and who will be accountable if promises are not met.</p>
<h2 id="5.-risks-linked-to-private-equity-involvement" tabindex="-1">5. Risks linked to private equity involvement</h2>
<h3 id="5.1-short-term-profit-vs-long-term-community-need" tabindex="-1">5.1 Short-term profit vs long-term community need</h3>
<p>Private equity funds typically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek to <strong>maximise returns within a fixed time frame</strong> (often 5–10 years).</li>
<li>Use <strong>leverage (debt)</strong> and financial engineering to boost profits.</li>
<li>Sell on assets once profit targets are achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can conflict with the needs of a new town, which require:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Up-front investment</strong> in infrastructure (roads, rail, schools, health).</li>
<li>Ongoing <strong>maintenance and stewardship</strong> over decades.</li>
<li>Delivering genuinely <strong>affordable housing</strong>, even when margins are tight.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lords report explicitly warns that new towns need <strong>“patient capital”</strong> and alternative funding models, not just profit-driven finance.</p>
<h3 id="5.2-example%3A-private-equity-and-the-high-street" tabindex="-1">5.2 Example: private equity and the high street</h3>
<p>The collapse of retailers such as <strong>Debenhams</strong> is frequently cited as a warning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debenhams was bought by a private equity consortium in 2003.</li>
<li>Owners extracted <strong>over £1bn in dividends</strong>, sold off property and loaded the business with debt.</li>
<li>Debenhams later collapsed, with thousands of job losses and empty stores in town centres.</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern – <strong>“take value out, leave risk behind”</strong> – is what worries many people about private equity running an entire new town.</p>
<h3 id="5.3-potential-issues-at-adlington" tabindex="-1">5.3 Potential issues at Adlington</h3>
<p>Community concerns include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affordable housing promises</strong> (e.g. 40% of homes) may be cut back later via “viability” arguments if they hit profit margins.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure may lag</strong> – homes might be built and sold quickly, while schools, surgeries and transport upgrades arrive late or only partially.</li>
<li>The town could be treated as an <strong>investment product</strong>, with:
<ul>
<li>Commercial areas and even community assets sold to the highest bidder.</li>
<li>Little long-term commitment to affordable rents or community facilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6.-key-talking-points-for-community-members" tabindex="-1">6. Key talking points for community members</h2>
<p>You can adapt these for letters, meetings, social media or petitions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Democracy and process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Adlington new town was <strong>selected behind closed doors</strong> by a national taskforce, with minimal local consultation, then announced as a shortlist “done deal”.</li>
<li>Decisions affecting our village for generations should be shaped through the <strong>Local Plan and public consultation</strong>, not by a private equity joint venture and a central taskforce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale and proportionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>14,000+ homes would transform a small rural village and its green belt into a town larger than many existing Cheshire settlements.</li>
<li>This is <strong>far beyond what was ever envisaged</strong> in local planning documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Green belt and environment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The site lies in the <strong>green belt</strong>, close to the Peak District National Park. Once built on, the land is <strong>irreversibly lost</strong> for farming, biodiversity and carbon storage.</li>
<li>National policy should prioritise <strong>brownfield regeneration</strong> and underused buildings before releasing high-quality green belt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure and public services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Local roads, schools, GPs and hospitals are already under pressure. A development of this size risks <strong>gridlock and overstretched services</strong> if infrastructure is not in place <em>first</em>.</li>
<li>The Lords have warned that <strong>front-loaded investment</strong> in transport and services is essential for new towns to succeed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private equity vs public interest</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The main landowner is a <strong>Belport–Revcap private equity joint venture</strong>. Their first legal duty is to investors, not to residents.</li>
<li>We have seen in the high street that private equity often extracts value quickly and moves on, leaving communities with the fallout. That model is <strong>not suitable for planning and running a town</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative approach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If new homes are needed, they should be:
<ul>
<li>Planned through <strong>democratic local processes</strong> (Local Plan).</li>
<li>Built with <strong>public oversight</strong> and, ideally, some public ownership via a development corporation.</li>
<li>Focused on <strong>brownfield sites</strong>, genuine affordability, and strong environmental protections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
